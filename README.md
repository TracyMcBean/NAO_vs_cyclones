# NAO_vs_cyclones
Analysis of cyclone tracks over the North Atlantic depending on the mean NAO index.

# Data
For NAO daily index the [NWS/NOAA](http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/nao.shtml) data is used.
The cyclone tracks are calculated using the reanalysis from [NCEP Climate Forecast System](http://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/).
Further data modification is done using the [Freie Universitaet Berlin Evaluation System](https://freva.met.fu-berlin.de/).
